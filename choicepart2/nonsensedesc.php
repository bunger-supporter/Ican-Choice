I'm writing down my idea (aka the first thing that popped into my mind)


Epic sonic underground website (because i am very normal)
    login page
- self explanatory

    sign up page
- self explanatory

    main page
- mostly nothing
- quick description of website
- links to different pages

    info page 
- whats sonic underground moment 
- gives character descriptions
- links entire show on youtube (because of course it's there)

    opinion piece
- copy pasted form on sonic underground (lol)
- changed slightly to have more detail

    opinion piece results 
- copy pasted from previous project too
- formated to be nicer
- doesn't allow delete (because why would you be able to delete if you were visiting?)

    "which character are you" quiz
- kinda similar to the last (cuz form)
- has more questions, all multiple choice
- gotta figure out how to calculate that score 

    quiz results 
- shows what you got in the end
- also shows you how many others got the same results
