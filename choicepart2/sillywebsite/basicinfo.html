    <h1>What is Sonic Underground?</h1>
    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>Sonic Underground is a cartoon released in 1999. It ran for one season, totaling 40 episodes, then was promptly cancelled. The show was created in order to increase interest for Sonic in time for the Dreamcast's release. Sonic Underground is mostly known for it's iconic theme song, as the actual stories are rushed and generally low quality. The plot was heavily inspired from the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon in 1993, and even reused character designs. The show has gained a cult following as people often associate it with nostalgic memories or enjoy its cheesiness. </p>
    <h2>The Plot</h2>
    <p>Sonic Underground follows the royal triplets Sonic, Manic, and Sonia. When they were born, their mother, Queen Aleena, was forced to abandon them as the evil Doctor Robotnik took control over Mobius. In the present day, Mobius has fallen into chaos and the triplets must overthrow Robotnik using their musical powers. It won't be easy, especially when they face Robotnik's minions Sleet and Dingo, but one day they will succeed and once again be reunited with their mother.</p>

        <div id = "sonc">
            <p>Sonic is the leader of the group and the eldest sibling. Known for his cool attitude and repeated catchphrases, Sonic speeds past the competition and always beats whatever challenges he faces. Within the band, he plays the guitar and is the main singer for the majority of the songs. One thing's for certain, he'll always be there for you in a Sonic second!</p>

        <div id = "sona">
            <p>Sonia is the middle child, and the only girl within the triplets. Raised within a rich foster family, Sonia can be quite particular at times. Despite her somewhat annoying personality, she always comes through at the end using a combination of her acrobatic skills, tornado spin, and keyboard laser blaster. She often acts as the emotional core within episodes, as her romantic interests such as Bartleby become the focus of individual stories. Though no matter what, she is always doing it with style.</p>
        </div>
        <div id = "manc">
            <p>Manic is the youngest triplet. Stolen as a child, Manic was raised by criminals, resulting in him often getting in trouble with the law. His crimes may be many, but he makes up for it through his skills with mechanics. Manic will often create devices to help with plans, or he'll simply cause an earthquake using his powerful drums, it depends on how he feels day by day.</p>
